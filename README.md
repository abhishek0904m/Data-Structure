# Data Structures Programs

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures programs** implemented in Java. The purpose of this repository is to help students practice and understand core concepts of data structures through simple, clear, and exam-oriented code examples.

## 📘 Overview

This repository includes solutions and implementations of various Data Structure concepts such as:

* Array-based problems
* Recursion-based problems
* Linked Lists
* Stacks & Queues
* Sorting & Searching Algorithms
* Tree & Graph basics
* String manipulation problems
* Number-based logic problems

New programs will be added regularly to expand the coverage of VTU and general Data Structures topics.

## 📁 Current Programs

* **Permutation.java** – Generates all permutations of digits and prints the next greater number formed.
* **LetterCombinations.java** – Generates all possible letter combinations for a given digit string based on the mobile keypad mapping.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder in your terminal.
3. Compile any Java program using:

   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:

   ```bash
   java ProgramName
   ```

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* To practice important Data Structure questions.
* To build a clean collection of DS programs for exams and interviews.
* To improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## 🤝 Contributions

You can contribute by adding more DS programs or optimizing existing ones.
